# DevDB
A VS Code extension that auto-loads your database. Built with ðŸ’– for developers.

DevDB brings [Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) into database management.


## Why?

Just DX. I want a DB client specifically designed for local development. I believe local develpoment DX should be better than this experience:
1. For any new project, I need to setup db connection in my app, AND in my DB client
2. I sometimes frequently tab in and tab out of them, switching between my IDE and DB client. Sometimes, frequent enough to make me question why I can't view my DB data directly in my IDE


Also, I find that most of the DB clients are clunky or simply overwhelm with all kinds of bells and whistles. I usually just want to view the data in my database.

Furthermore, I love beautiful UIs. DB clients have evolved to generally not have beautiful UIs.

I want a database GUI tool that lives in my IDE, and mostly auto-detects and connects with my app's database. I want it to be simple, fast, intuitive, and clean.

Hence, DevDB ðŸš€
